        <h3>BUILT WITH PURPOSE</h3>
        <p>
          Carecard is a prescription savings network created for people to save on their prescription medicine. Prescription medications, like most products, are cheaper when purchased in bulk. By partnering with pharmacy suppliers, we&#39;re able to provide you savings on your prescriptions with our Carecard. By negotiating with pharmacies to provide low-cost medications, we bring discounted prices to consumers. You don’t have to sign up for anything, and there is no cost associated with using our cards or coupons. No matter if you are insured, uninsured or have a high deductible, we offer the lowest prescription prices on thousands of medications.
        </p>
        <h3>WHY CARECARD</h3>
        <p>
          Still, millions of Americans remain uninsured and/or underinsured. Even under the ACA, many uninsured people cite the high cost of insurance as the main reason they lack coverage. Many people do not have access to coverage through a job, and some people, particularly poor adults in states that did not expand Medicaid, remain ineligible for financial assistance for coverage. Some people who are eligible for financial assistance under the ACA may not know they can get help, and others may still find the cost of coverage prohibitive. By introducing buying power into the prescription space, our members are able to save up to 80% on some of their prescriptions. This can mean life or death in some instances.<br><br>
          In short, prescriptions cost too much….so we’re fixing that.
