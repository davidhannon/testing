        <p>
          Carecard is not insurance. We’re working to make prescription medicine more accessible and affordable for customers paying out-of- pocket for services. That said, there are times when Carecard can help Medicare recipients who pay too much for prescription medication. Since each plan is different, we recommend contacting your plan administrator to find out what Carecard can do for you. Regardless of your insurance status, Carecard usually provides the cheapest price for your prescriptions.
