          <h3>Built with Commitment</h3>
          <span>We created Carecard to for Americans to save on their prescriptions. Prescription medications, like most products, are cheaper when purchased in bulk. By partnering with pharmacy suppliers, we're able to provide you savings on your prescriptions with our Carecard. By negotiating with pharmacies to provide low-cost medications, we bring discounted prices to consumers. You donâ€™t have to sign up for anything, and there is no cost associated with using our cards or coupons.</span><br>
          <span>No matter if you are insured, uninsured or have a high deductible, we offer the lowest prescription prices on thousands of medications.</span>
          <h3>When to use Carecard:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>When you have no insurance</li>
            <li>When you are underinsured</li>
            <li>When your deductible is too high</li>
